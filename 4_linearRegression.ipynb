    "## Linear Regression\n",
    "```\n",
    "Linear regression is a type of supervised machine learning algorithm that computes the linear relationship between a dependent variable and one or more independent features. When the number of the independent feature, is 1 then it is known as Univariate Linear regression, and in the case of more than one feature, it is known as multivariate linear regression. The goal of the algorithm is to find the best linear equation that can predict the value of the dependent variable based on the independent variables. The equation provides a straight line that represents the relationship between the dependent and independent variables. The slope of the line indicates how much the dependent variable changes for a unit change in the independent variable(s).\n",
    "```\n",
    "* Linear regression is used in many different fields, including finance, economics, and psychology, to understand and predict the behavior of a particular variable. For example, in finance, linear regression might be used to understand the relationship between a companyâ€™s stock price and its earnings or to predict the future value of a currency based on its past performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "* One of the most important supervised learning tasks is regression. In regression set of records are present with X and Y values and these values are used to learn a function so if you want to predict Y from an unknown X this learned function can be used. In regression we have to find the value of Y, So, a function is required that predicts continuous Y in the case of regression given X as independent features.\n",

    "## Assumption for Linear Regression Model\n",
    "Linear regression is a powerful tool for understanding and predicting the behavior of a variable, however, it needs to meet a few conditions in order to be accurate and dependable solutions. \n",
    "\n",
    "* Linearity: The independent and dependent variables have a linear relationship with one another. This implies that changes in the dependent variable follow those in the independent variable(s) in a linear fashion.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Independence: The observations in the dataset are independent of each other. This means that the value of the dependent variable for one observation does not depend on the value of the dependent variable for another observation.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Homoscedasticity: Across all levels of the independent variable(s), the variance of the errors is constant. This indicates that the amount of the independent variable(s) has no impact on the variance of the errors.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Normality: The errors in the model are normally distributed. \n",
    "\n",
    "* No multicollinearity: There is no high correlation between the independent variables. This indicates that there is little or no correlation between the independent variables."
