    "K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) is a simple and popular classification algorithm used for supervised learning tasks. It's a type of instance-based learning, or lazy learning, where the algorithm makes predictions based on the K most similar training examples in the feature space. Here's how the KNN classification algorithm works:\n",

    "### How KNN Classification Works:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Training Phase:**\n",
    "   - The algorithm stores all the training data points in memory. Each data point consists of features and their corresponding class labels.\n",
    "  \n",
    "2. **Prediction Phase:**\n",
    "   - Given a new data point (with unknown class label), the algorithm calculates the distances between this point and all the training points. Common distance metrics include Euclidean distance, Manhattan distance, or Minkowski distance.\n",
    "   \n",
    "3. **K Nearest Neighbors:**\n",
    "   - The algorithm identifies the K training examples with the shortest distances to the new data point.\n",
    "  \n",
    "4. **Majority Voting:**\n",
    "   - For classification, KNN takes a majority vote among the K nearest neighbors to determine the class of the new data point. In other words, the class that occurs most frequently among the K neighbors is assigned to the new data point.\n",
    "  \n",
    "5. **Decision Rule:**\n",
    "   - K is a hyperparameter that needs to be specified in advance. The choice of K affects the model's accuracy. Smaller values of K can make the model more sensitive to noise in the data, while larger values can smooth out decision boundaries.\n",

    "### Steps for Implementing KNN Classification (in Python using scikit-learn):\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "from sklearn.neighbors import KNeighborsClassifier\n",
    "from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split\n",
    "from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score\n",
    "\n",
    "# Load your dataset (X: features, y: labels)\n",
    "# X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)\n",
    "\n",
    "# Initialize KNN Classifier with the desired number of neighbors (K)\n",
    "knn_classifier = KNeighborsClassifier(n_neighbors=3)\n",
    "\n",
    "# Train the classifier using the training data\n",
    "knn_classifier.fit(X_train, y_train)\n",
    "\n",
    "# Make predictions on the test data\n",
    "predictions = knn_classifier.predict(X_test)\n",
    "\n",
    "# Evaluate the accuracy of the model\n",
    "accuracy = accuracy_score(y_test, predictions)\n",
    "print(\"Accuracy:\", accuracy)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, `n_neighbors` is set to 3, meaning the algorithm considers 3 nearest neighbors for classification. You can adjust this value based on your specific dataset and problem requirements.\n",
    "\n",
    "Remember that KNN is sensitive to the scale of features, so it's often a good practice to scale the features before applying KNN to ensure that all features contribute equally to the distance calculations."
